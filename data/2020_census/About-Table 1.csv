,,,,Statement on Data Accuracy,,,,,,,,,,,,,
New York City Decennial Census Data,,,,"Under Title 13 of the U.S. Code, the Census Bureau is legally bound to protect the privacy of individuals participating in the decennial census. To adhere to the law and to avoid the disclosure of information about individual respondents, the Census Bureau has historically applied a host of techniques, such as top- and bottom-coding, imputation, table- and cell-suppression, and data swapping. The Census Bureau is employing a new technique with the 2020 Census, referred to as the Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS), based on differential privacy. With this approach, the Census Bureau “infuses noise” systematically across census data and sets a quantified disclosure risk, referred to as the Privacy Loss Budget (PLB).",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,"While the new DAS approach may diminish the risk of disclosure concerns, it comes at a cost to data accuracy. Consequently, 2020 Census data users should be aware that all sub-state counts, except for housing units (which are unaffected by the DAS), may be adjusted to protect the privacy of Census participants and may be subject to reduced accuracy. Because DAS noise infusion is randomized, it is impossible for data users to know the degree to which any individual statistic is altered. However, it is possible to say that in general the relative size of errors decreases as counts increase. Consequently, data users should have greater confidence in the accuracy of the data as counts get larger. Further, an evaluation of a Privacy-Protected Microdata File (PPMF), treated with a Disclosure Avoidance System like the one applied to 2020 redistricting data, showed that counts of 300 or more rarely have sizable errors (error beyond +/- 10% of the count). Therefore, while data users need to be cognizant of data accuracy limitations, they should have confidence in conclusions based on sizable counts, which are relatively unaffected by the Census Bureau’s latest disclosure avoidance method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Note that two CDs (Queens CD 401 and Bronx CD 208) cross borough boundaries, and therefore CDs will not add up to borough totals for the Bronx, Queens, and Manhattan. Similarly, one NTA (BX0802) crosses borough boundaries, and therefore NTAs will not add up to borough totals for the Bronx and Manhattan. Also note that census tracts in New York City’s water areas are excluded from this file.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
